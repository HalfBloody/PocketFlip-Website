# CONFIGURATION AND EXPLANATION OF POCKETFLIP WEBSITE #

This website is made with Jekyll and necessary ruby gems.

To make changes to this repository add this repo to your local computer. After you pulled all the data, open up your terminal and navigate to the directory with the pulled repo. In the terminal run `jekyll serve` command.
This will generate the site, and you can see it on `localhost:4000` in your browser.

To make any changes, you need to understand the structure of the website first. Here is the breakdown:


## **_assets** folder

All the assets for the pocketflip website are stored here. Javascript, CSS, Images **note:** the asset pipeline doesn't work right now, so the images are stored in the root directory.

## **_data** folder

All the structural data, like navigations, their links and name of the tabs are stored here for easy manipulation. Think of it as small database you can take the data from.

## **_includes** folder

This folder contains all the partials which are then called in the pages or templates.

'Shared' - the partials which are shared across multiple pages. Like navigation, footer....

'Modules' - the partials which are specific to a certain template like articles.

'Landing' - the partials which are specific for the landing page.

'Analytics' - partials for the different analytics. **note** not fully implemented yet


## **_layouts** folder

All the different layouts for different pages. For example, default.html is the default layout that pages and posts inherit from. But the landing.html has a new layout specific for the landing page.


## **_pages** folder

Currently empty, but if you want to create pages like contact us, this is the place you do it.


## **_plugins** folder

If you want to use "guard" to refresh the page in the browser when saving a change, this is where it all happens. In general, you won't touch this folder.

## **_posts** folder

Currently, there is nothing in here. If you want to have a blog with articles with time stamps on them, this is where it'll happen ;)

## **_site** folder -- **IMPORTANT !!!**

**DO NOT TOUCH THIS FOLDER**
This folder is generated by `Jeykll` itself when you run `jekyll serve` in the terminal.
